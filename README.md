# Project Goals

The primary goal of BP Workout Plans is to provide a web-based fitness community, that allows users to create, search, save, delete and share their favourite workout plans with fellow members.

# Five Development Planes

## 1. Strategy Development Plane

Here is how I broke down the Strategy Development Plane:

1. Users/ Members
   * Users (not registered/ not signed up)
   * Members (signed up/ logged in)

2. Demographic/ Target Audience
   * Loves going to the gym/ working out
   * Gym goers looking for workout plans
   * Gym goers of all ages
   * Gym goers of all levels

3. The website will need to enable a user to:
   * Sign Up for an account
   * Log into their account once signed up
   * Contact the site owner/ Developer using the contact form
   * Find workout plans created by members
   * View members workout plans
   * Search using the search bar input for specific workout plans

4. The website will need to enable a member to:
   * Log into their account
   * Contact the site owner/ Developer using the contact form
   * Find workout plans created by other members
   * View other members workout plans
   * Search using the seach bar input for specific workout plans
   * Create their own workout plans to share with the community
   * Edit their own workout plans to make changes
   * Delete their own workout plans (if needed)
   * View their profile
   * Edit their account to change either their username or password
   * Delete their account if they would like to
   * View their own workout plans created by themselves

With the above strategy options in mind, I have created a User & Member strategy table (below) to show the importance and viability for all of the following options:

### User Strategy Table



### Member Strategy Table



## 2. Scope Development Plane

Here is how I broke down the Scope Development Plane in order to align with the Strategy Development Plane listed above. The Scope Development Plane is broken down into two categories:

### 1. Content Requirements


### 2. Functionality Requirements


## 3. Structure Development Plane

Within the Structure Development Plane I have created a hierarchial structure chart to show how the users & members of BP Workout Plans can navigate around the site with ease and efficiency, the hierarchial structure chart is displayed below:

### User Structure Chart



### Member Structure Chart



## 4. Skeleton Development Plane

The wireframe mockups for BP Workout Plans were created using Adobe XD with the User Experience and User Interface in mind:

### Home Page



### Sign Up Page



### Log In Page



### Contact Page



### Find Workout Plans Page



### Create A Workout Plan Page



### Edit Workout Plan Page



### Workout Plan Page



### My Workout Plans Page



### View Profile Page



### Edit Account Page



### Member Navigation Bar



# 5. Surface Development Plane

### Colors



### Typography

The primary font used with BP Workout Plans was "Poppins". I wanted the font to match well with the UI of the website with its simplicity but was also very easy to read and understand.

The secondary font used was "San Serif" which would display if the primary font was not able to load onto the user/ members device.

### Images/ Screenshots

The images/ screenshots used within BP Workout Plans or the README.md file were created using Adobe XD. Using Adobe XD for the entirety of my project allowed me to keep a good consistency throughout.
