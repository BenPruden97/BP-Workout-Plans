# Five Development Planes

## 1. Strategy Development Plane

Here is how I broke down the Strategy Development Plane:

1. Users/ Members
   * Users (not registered/ not signed up)
   * Members (signed up/ logged in)

2. Demographic/ Target Audience
   * Loves going to the gym/ working out
   * Gym goers looking for workout plans
   * Gym goers of all ages
   * Gym goers of all levels

3. The website will need to enable a user to:
   * Sign Up for an account
   * Log into their account once signed up
   * Contact the site owner/ Developer using the contact form
   * Find workout plans created by members
   * View members workout plans
   * Search using the search bar input for specific workout plans

4. The website will need to enable a member to:
   * Log into their account
   * Contact the site owner/ Developer using the contact form
   * Find workout plans created by other members
   * View other members workout plans
   * Search using the seach bar input for specific workout plans
   * Create their own workout plans to share with the community
   * Edit their own workout plans to make changes
   * Delete their own workout plans (if needed)
   * View their profile
   * Edit their account to change either their username or password
   * Delete their account if they would like to
   * View their own workout plans created by themselves

With the above strategy options in mind, I have created a User & Member strategy table (below) to show the importance and viability for all of the following options:

## 3. Structure Development Plane

## 4. Skeleton Development Plane

The wireframe mockups for BP Workout Plans were created using Adobe XD with the User Experience and User Interface in mind:

### Colors

![Project Colors](https://github.com/BenPruden97/BP-Workout-Plans/blob/main/static/screenshots/project-colors.png)

### Typography

The primary font used with BP Workout Plans was "Poppins". I wanted the font to match well with the UI of the website with its simplicity but was also very easy to read and understand.

The secondary font used was "San Serif" which would display if the primary font was not able to load onto the user/ members device.

### Images/ Screenshots

The images/ screenshots used within BP Workout Plans or the README.md file were created using Adobe XD. Using Adobe XD for the entirety of my project allowed me to keep a good consistency throughout.

# Data Schema

I used MongoDB  to store my data for my BP Workout Plans project. Within MongoDB I created four collections to store different types of data for different members and workout plans. The four data collections are displayed below:

1[Data Scheme Tables](https://github.com/BenPruden97/BP-Workout-Plans/blob/main/static/screenshots/data-schema.png)

## Members Collection

The Members collection stored the following data for the Sign Up Page to allow the user to create an account and be able to Log In once created:

* Username (Unique username used to log in using the log in page)
* Email Address
* Password (Unique password used to log in using the log in page)

## Workout Plans Collection

The Workout Plans collection stored the following data to allow members to Create, Read, Update & Delete Workout Plans to share with the community

* Workout Plan Muscle Group (Workout Plan Category Collection)
* Workout Plan Difficulty (Workout Plan Difficulty Collection)
* Workout Plan Name
* Workout Plan Description
* Exercise Name: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 & 6

* Rest Time: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 & 6
* Weight Used: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 & 6

## Workout Plans Category Collection

The Workout Plan Category Collection stores five muscle groups that the member can choose from to base their workout plan around. Those five options are:

* Chest
* Back
* Arms
* Legs
* Shoulders

Each category has its own image selected for users/ members to tell which muscle group each workout plan is based around.

## Workout Plans Difficulty Collection

The Workout Plan Difficulty Collection stores three difficulty options for the member to choose from. Those three options are:

* Beginner
* Intermediate
* Advanced

Having this option allows for users/ members of all fitness levels to feel included.
