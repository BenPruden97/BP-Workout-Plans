# Testing Code Validation

### HTML Validation

I used [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) to validate my HTML code for all pages.
* Home Page - Anchor Tag nested of place that is needed.
* Find A Workouts Plan Page - Duplicate Class Used for if statement images.
* Sign Up Page - No Errors
* Log In Page - No Errors
* Contact Page - No Errors
* Create A Workout Plan Page - Have Name & Id attribute within a p tag to display a value.
* Workout Plan Page - value displaying within a p tag and bootstrap accordion code error.
* Edit Workout Plan Page - value displaying errors
* My Workout Plans Page - No Errors
* View Profile Page - No Errors
* Edit Account Page - No Errors

### CSS Validation

I used [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to validate my CSS style sheet.

There were no errors within the file

![CSS Validation](https://github.com/BenPruden97/BP-Workout-Plans/blob/main/static/screenshots/css-validation.png)

### Javascript Validation

I used [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) to validate my Javascript files.

The errors found were from:
* CONST being used to declare variables
* Using SweetAlert & EmailJS for the contact form feedback
* The unused variables are from onclicks and modals

![JSHint Validation](https://github.com/BenPruden97/BP-Workout-Plans/blob/main/static/screenshots/js-hint.png)

### Python Code Checking

I used the flask extension flake8 to check the app.py for any errors.
